Router Simulation Docker Image
This Docker image provides a simulation of a router using Python code. It allows users to simulate basic router operations and interactions using Python scripts.

Usage
Pulling the Docker Image
To pull the Docker image from Docker Hub, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
docker pull your_username/router-simulation:latest
Replace your_username with your Docker Hub username.

Running the Docker Container
To run the Docker container, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
docker run -d --name router-simulation your_username/router-simulation:latest
This command will start the router simulation container in detached mode.

Accessing the Router Simulation
Once the container is running, you can access the router simulation using Python code. You can interact with the simulation by executing Python scripts inside the running container or by connecting to the container using Docker exec.

Configuring and Customizing
The router simulation can be configured and customized by modifying the Python code inside the Docker container. You can edit the Python scripts to simulate different router behaviors, network topologies, or packet routing algorithms.

Prerequisites
Docker installed on your system
Basic knowledge of Docker and Python programming
Dependencies
The Docker image includes the following dependencies:

Python 3.x
Any additional Python libraries required for the router simulation (e.g., NumPy, matplotlib)
Examples
Below are examples of how to interact with the router simulation using Python code:

Connecting Devices to the Router:

python
Copy code
from router_simulation import Router

router = Router()
router.connect_device("Desktop PC")
router.connect_device("Smartphone")
Sending Packets through the Router:

python
Copy code
from router_simulation import Router

router = Router()
router.send_packet("Desktop PC", "Smartphone", "Hello, World!")
Viewing Connected Devices:

python
Copy code
from router_simulation import Router

router = Router()
connected_devices = router.get_connected_devices()
print("Connected Devices:", connected_devices)
Disconnecting Devices from the Router:

python
Copy code
from router_simulation import Router

router = Router()
router.disconnect_device("Smartphone")
